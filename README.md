# WYA (Where You At)

My take on a traditional full-stack social network web application. 
Created with Python, Django, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Based on one of the projects from the advanded CS50W course called Web Programming with Python and Javascript but hugely modified, improved and with my own design.

Developed by Simone Abbamonte, October 2020
